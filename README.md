Food Demand Dynamics with Advanced Regression Techniques and Deep Learning Models
This project mainly focuses on the critical task of demand forecasting in food industry where the shelf life is limited and mismanaged inventory can lead to significant losses. In this project i leveraged the most advanced regeression techniques and deep learning models to build a system that forecasts the demand in a food industry. the model analyzes the past 10 months data and the forecasting will happen to the next four months.
